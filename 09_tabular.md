## 9. Tabular queestions

1. A continuous variable is a numeric variable that can have mathematical operations performed (they make sense to perform)

2. A categorical variable is a variable that contains discrete 'levels'. They can also be numeric if performing mathematical operations is not logical (IDs)

3. Possible values for categorical variables are know as levels, classes, or categories.

4. A dense layer is the same as a linear layer - it performs matrix multiplication and adds a bias. The only slight difference is that dense layers may contain non-linear activations after performing the matrix multiplication and bias addition.
