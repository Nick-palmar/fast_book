## Fastbook Repo 

This repo contains work from the fast.ai deep learning for coders course.

In general, there are 3 types of files: redos of practice exercises, written comprehension questions about deep learning, and self directed projects about topics in each section. 

**This course is a work in progress**. I already completed part 1 of the course (first 10 chapters). I am currently working through the second part where I have learned about NLP (RNN and LSTM from the foundations) as well as computer vision architectures (CNN and ResNet from the foundations). I have left the course on hold for now but I will complete that few sections I have left in the future.
