## Fastbook Repo 

This repo contains work from the fast.ai deep learning for coders course.

In general, there are 3 types of files: redos of practice exercises, written comprehension questions about deep learning, and self directed projects about topics in each section. 

**This course is a work in progress; I am aiming to finish part 1 of the course before September (covers various topics in deep learning)**
