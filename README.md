## Fastbook Repo 

This repo contains work from the fast.ai deep learning for coders course.

In general, there are 3 types of files: redos of practice exercises, written comprehension questions about deep learning, and self directed projects about topics in each section. 

**This course is a work in progress; as of October 2021 I will have completed the first part of this course (the first 10 chapters of the book). I am aiming to complete the second part: deep learning from the foundations before January 2022**
